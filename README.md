# Platformer Game

This is a simple platformer game built from scratch using C++ and [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) as the graphical library. The game features handmade physics and a custom map system, providing a classic platforming experience.

## Features

- **Handmade Physics:** All movement, gravity, and collision detection are implemented manually for full control and learning purposes.
- **Custom Map System:** Levels are defined using a custom format, allowing easy editing and expansion.
